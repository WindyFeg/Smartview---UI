## What is SMARTVIEW?
SMARTVIEW is a social phone review site, which means users can upload their reviews, personal experience
with a certain smartphone product, or view reviews posted by other users.\\

With the SMARTVIEW, we hope to solve the current problems by creating an web application, furthermore
a community, where people can freely post their own reviews. Thus users can directly interact with each other,
thereby increasing objectivity and accuracy of the reviews.
