## README
I have call API in the code so make sure:.\
1. Run server on port 3000.\
2. If you get `CORS POLICY ERROR` turn CORS POLICY off (you can using Moesif CORS extension on chrome).\

### `npm start` 
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
